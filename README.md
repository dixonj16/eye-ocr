# OCR - Javascript

Need I say more? But just for the heck of it let's see if we can do better...

This is a javascript library for very basic optical character recognition. The intent of this library is to extract text from images of your everyday documents. This should mean that the text we are working with clear, readable, and distinguishable. It is outside the scope of this project to deal with images such as captchas. Although depending on how this goes we may get there.
